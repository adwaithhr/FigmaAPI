## How it Works ?
The Figma Color Theme Detector Plugin is seamlessly integrated into the Figma design tool as a plugin, accessible through the plugins menu. Once activated, users can open their desired Figma design file for analysis. The plugin intelligently examines the design elements to identify the primary color theme used. It then presents users with a curated list of alternative color themes in various shades that harmonize with the original design. The plugin's JavaScript functions facilitate smooth color conversions between HEX, RGB, and HSL formats, enabling precise calculations for optimal color matching. When users select their preferred color theme, the plugin efficiently applies the chosen color fills to the relevant design elements in the Figma file.
